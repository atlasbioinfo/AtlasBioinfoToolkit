# Bioinformatics Toolbox (preview)

This project is a web application that provides a collection of commonly used bioinformatics tools. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface and enable users to perform various bioinformatics analyses directly in the browser.

## Features

The Bioinformatics Toolbox currently includes the following tools:

1. Sequence Manipulation: This tool allows users to perform operations on DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, such as reverse complement, translation, and sequence formatting.

2. Multiple Sequence Alignment: Users can input multiple sequences and align them using popular algorithms like ClustalW or Muscle.

3. Primer Design: This tool assists users in designing primers for PCR experiments. It suggests primer pairs based on specific criteria such as melting temperature, GC content, and amplicon size.

4. BLAST Search: Users can perform nucleotide or protein sequence searches against various databases using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST).

5. Phylogenetic Analysis: This tool enables users to build phylogenetic trees based on sequence data, using algorithms like neighbor-joining or maximum likelihood.

6. Motif Search: Users can search for known motifs or patterns within DNA or protein sequences using tools like MEME or HMMER.

7. Gene Expression Analysis: This tool provides statistical analysis and visualization options for gene expression data, including differential expression analysis and clustering.

## Installation

To use the Bioinformatics Toolbox locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/bioinformatics-toolbox.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd bioinformatics-toolbox`

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. Upon opening the `index.html` file, you will be presented with the Bioinformatics Toolbox interface.

2. Select the desired tool from the navigation menu on the left.

3. Follow the instructions provided on each tool's page to input your data and configure the analysis parameters.

4. Once you have filled in the necessary information, click the "Submit" or "Run" button to initiate the analysis.

5. Wait for the analysis to complete, and the results will be displayed on the page or available for download.

## Contributing

Contributions to the Bioinformatics Toolbox are welcome! If you would like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature-name`

3. Make the necessary changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add feature-name'`

4. Push your changes to the new branch: `git push origin feature-name`

5. Open a pull request on the original repository.
